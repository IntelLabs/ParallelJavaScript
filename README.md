ParallelJavaScript
==================

This repository contains a collection of example workloads for Parallel JavaScript. 
We plan to add more workloads over time and welcome contributions.

How To Use
==========

The workloads in this repository use the Parallel JavaScript API as proposed in the [ECMA TC39 strawman for data parallelism](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:data_parallelism).
To run the workloads, you will need a browser with support for the [typed objects API](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:typed_objects) and an implementation of Parallel JavaScript.
For the former, you can watch implementation progress in Firefox [here](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578700).
The latter is available as a [library implementation](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/pjs-polyfill).
